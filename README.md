# ballotbox

I'm working on developing a simple voting application in Rust implemented as a TELNET server ðŸ˜‚ just for fun. You can connect to a server which can start a new vote, and you get to pick and after a certain time the results are broadcasted to everybody!

Inspired by [Tsoding's `Multiuser Chat`` series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbIEuNscn_E) and the November 2023 Dutch elections.
